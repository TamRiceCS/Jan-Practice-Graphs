Implementation Details

-Menu Options

Node
- Weight (int)
- Neighbor (Node*)

Graph
- hasNegative (boolean)
- aList (boolean)
- aMatrix (boolean)
- return neighbors (vector int) // will need to be overwritten
- output graph // [] or -> 


ALGraph > inherits Graph
- create graph w/ adjacency list of Nodes
- needs a constuctor that recieves a file

AMGraph > inherits Graph
- creates a graph w/ a matrix of ints
- needs a constructor that recieves a file

// The aim is to create more specific graphs but to only call high level graph functions.
